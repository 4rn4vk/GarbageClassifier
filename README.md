## 📖 Overview

**Garbage Classifier** is a deep learning project designed to classify waste into different categories (e.g., Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Trash) using Computer Vision. Proper waste segregation is crucial for recycling and environmental conservation; this project automates that process using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

This repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a prediction script to test the model on new images.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Class Classification:** Identifies various types of waste (Plastic, Paper, Metal, Glass, etc.).
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a custom CNN (or Transfer Learning via ResNet/MobileNet) for high accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation:** Implements image processing techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Easy Inference:** Simple script to classify images from your local machine.
